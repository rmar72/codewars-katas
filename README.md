## What's a kata?

A kata basically is an algorithm you have to solve in any programming language you desire.

## What's kyu?

Kyu digit determines kata difficulty level as well as the user rank on the platform.

## Node.js versions & ES6+ support

The current Node versions [available](https://github.com/Codewars/codewars.com/wiki/Language-JavaScript) are the following:

- [Node.js v6.11.0](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/#node6_5)
- [Node.js v8.1.3](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/#node8_7)

## Purpose

Practicing katas could help you to improve your algorithmic thinking. It could also helps going to interviews more confident.
I highly recommend the [Tech Interview Handbook](https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook) which will help you ace your next technical interview.
